An analysis of local price changes for bitcoin.

Order systems that quote users a final up-front rate and await payment before executing on the liquidity-sourcing venue, are naturally exposed to price fluctuations that can impact the profitability of each trade.

Depending on the payment method, the time between initial quote presentation and payment completion will vary e.g card payments take less time to complete (initiate + settle) than real-time bank-transfer based payments.

The objective of this analysis is to investigate and quanitfy the local changes in price for cryptocurrencies, whose volatility  may present a problem in the context of profitable pricing.

This analysis could help inform brokerages and other parties that operate order execution systems that operate using the abovementioned setup.
